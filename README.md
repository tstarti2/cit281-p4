# Project: Node.js REST API for Questions and Answers

## Learning Objectives

Upon completing this project, you will:

- Develop proficiency in interpreting functional descriptions and specifications to complete an assignment effectively.
- Gain experience in breaking down a project into manageable components for efficient development.
- Enhance your skills in writing and executing Node.js JavaScript code using Visual Studio Code (VSCode).
- Practice creating and using code modules to organize and modularize your codebase effectively.
- Utilize modern JavaScript syntax in your codebase.
- Gain practical experience in building and running a Node.js REST API server using Fastify with various HTTP verbs, routes, and route parameters.
- Work with static data to simulate a data source for questions and answers.
- Test your code module without using a web server and use Postman to test web server routes.
- Work with JSON data formats.
- (Extra Credit) Gain experience using Fastify with POST, PUT, and DELETE verbs.

## Overview

In this project, you will create a REST API to manage a collection of questions and answers. You will implement the code to interact with the data source using a code module and test it using provided testing code. Additionally, you will develop a Node.js REST API server to handle the GET verb for retrieving questions and answers.

### Project Tasks:

1. **Data Module Creation:**
   - Create a code module to manage questions and answers data.
   - Implement functions to interact with the data, such as fetching all questions, retrieving a specific question by ID, adding a new question, updating an existing question, and deleting a question.
   - Test the code module using provided testing code without using a web server.

2. **REST API Implementation:**
   - Develop a Node.js REST API server using Fastify to handle GET requests for retrieving questions and answers.
   - Define routes for fetching all questions, retrieving a specific question by ID, adding a new question, updating an existing question, and deleting a question.
   - Use static data to simulate a data source for questions and answers.

3. **Testing and Documentation:**
   - Use Postman to test the web server routes to ensure they function as expected.
   - Ensure proper error handling and response formatting in your REST API.
   - Document your code and APIs for clarity and maintainability.

Completing this project will provide you with valuable experience in building RESTful APIs, working with data sources, handling HTTP requests, and testing API endpoints.
