# Project 4: Node.js REST API for Questions and Answers

In this project, I tackled several learning objectives, culminating in the creation of a robust REST API for managing a collection of questions and answers. Here's what I accomplished:

## Learning Objectives

- **Interpreting Specifications:** I developed proficiency in interpreting functional descriptions and specifications, enabling me to understand and fulfill project requirements effectively.
- **Project Breakdown:** I gained experience in breaking down complex projects into manageable components, streamlining the development process for efficiency.
- **Node.js Coding Skills:** I enhanced my skills in writing and executing Node.js JavaScript code using Visual Studio Code (VSCode) as my primary development environment.
- **Modularizing Codebase:** I practiced creating and utilizing code modules to organize and modularize my codebase effectively, promoting code reusability and maintainability.
- **Modern JavaScript Syntax:** I utilized modern JavaScript syntax throughout my codebase, ensuring cleaner and more efficient code structures.
- **Building REST API with Fastify:** I gained practical experience in building a Node.js REST API server using Fastify, implementing various HTTP verbs, routes, and route parameters.
- **Working with Static Data:** I worked with static data to simulate a data source for questions and answers, honing my data management skills.
- **Testing and Documentation:** I thoroughly tested my code modules without using a web server and employed Postman to test the web server routes, ensuring proper functionality. Additionally, I documented my code and APIs for clarity and maintainability.

## Overview of Project Tasks

1. **Data Module Creation:** I created a code module to manage questions and answers data, implementing functions to interact with the data and thoroughly testing the module.
2. **REST API Implementation:** I developed a Node.js REST API server using Fastify to handle GET requests for retrieving questions and answers. I defined routes for various CRUD operations and utilized static data as the data source.
3. **Testing and Documentation:** I extensively tested the web server routes using Postman, ensuring proper error handling and response formatting. I also documented my code and APIs to facilitate understanding and future maintenance.

Through this project, I gained valuable experience in building RESTful APIs, working with data sources, handling HTTP requests, and testing API endpoints, further solidifying my skills as a Node.js developer.
